# README PHOTOS

In this folder, you'll find the various photographs used in the main README.md file of the repository, with the exception of the photos of the robot's sides, which are located in the vehicle-photos folder.

Here you'll also find the original version of the README.md document, which we used for several months before replacing it with the current version, as well as the various photographs that were used as placeholders. We keep all of this here for project archiving purposes.
